# a2ln-node

`a2ln-node` aims to be a node library to easily act as a server for [a2ln-app](https://github.com/patri9ck/a2ln-app) , making it easy to write other programs which perform certain actions based on notifications from your phone.

Kind of a port of  [a2ln-server](https://github.com/patri9ck/a2ln-server) , but as a library, rather than to be used directly.

## TODO

- [ ] Events for Notifications
